								Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many
								people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the
								nature of the Universe than we do now.

							<div class="tabs-item-title">Quote 3</div>
							<div class="tabs-item-description">
								It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to
								be in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite
								number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe
								can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people
								you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination.

							<div class="tabs-item-title">Quote 4</div>
							<div class="tabs-item-description">
								There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will
								instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states
								that this has already happened.

							<div class="tabs-item-description">
								Just beat the devil out of it. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Let's get wild today.

							<div class="tabs-item-title">Quote 6</div>
							<div class="tabs-item-description">
								Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. Little short strokes. In this world, everything can be happy. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. In your world you can create anything you desire. Get tough with it, get strong. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. That's crazy. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud.
